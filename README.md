Learning 2D in Unreal Engine

Project: QuickDraw (Finished)

This project is a game to test your reflex by pressing the attack button (Spacebar) when the Exclamation Point appears on the screen.

Things Learned/Used from this project: 
- Paper2D: Import, fixing the blurry textures, changing material to TranslucentUnlitSpriteMaterial, creating a sprite, changing the translucency
- Timelines: Using keyframes to create a simple animation for setting the relative locations of sprites
- Enumerations: changing the enum for phases of the game
- Input Action & Input Mapping Context: allows us to create an input
